# [Groot Level 2](https://underthewire.tech/groot-2)
## Description
"The password for groot3 is the word that is made up from the letters in the range of 1,481,110 to 1,481,117 within the file on the desktop.

**NOTE:**

â€“ The password will be lowercase no matter how it appears on the screen."

## Solution
This level is very straightforward: there is a large text file on the desktop and we need to pull a single word out of it within the provided character index range. There are several possible solutions.

1. Using the same `Substring()` method from the solution for the previous level, we can simply plug in the character range given to us in the description. Recall that the `Substring()` method takes two parameters: the index of the character to start at and the length of the substring that you want.

2. Alternatively, we can use bracket notation with the range of the indexes of the letters along with the `-Join` option to concatenate them.

**Final command:** `(Get-Content \.elements.txt).Substring(1481110,7)`

OR

`(Get-Content \.elements.txt)[1481111..1481117] -Join ''`

**Password for groot3:** hiding
